Life and Times of the Inform Library
====================================

This release of the Inform Library marks the first release of the Inform 
6 library after custody was taken over by David Griffith.  This release 
focuses mainly on bugs reported at 
http://www.inform-fiction.org/patches/library.html.



New things added in Release 6/12
================================

There is now a Global no_infer_message which can be used in the 
ChooseObjects() routine to suppress an inference message for a 
particular match.




Issues addressed in Release 6/12 (12????)
=========================================
Issue L61101
each_turn property causes runtime error.
Problem: An each_turn property with both a local routine and a routine 
inherited from a Class causes a runtime error in Strict mode.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61102
GET IN now matches Compass object
Adding "in_obj.&name-->0 = '.ignore';" to Initialise() reverts back to 
the previous behavior.  
Status: Maybe fix?

Issue L61105
'Game uses colour' bit is always set.
Problem: Every game compiled with the 6/11 library has the 'game uses 
colour' bit set in the Flags2 header word.
Fixed: From now on, if you want a game to use color, add "Constant 
COLOUR;" or "Constant COLOR;" to the beginning of your code.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61106
Improvement to LibraryExtensions.RunUntil
Problem: The LibraryExtensions.RunUntil property (new at 6/11 and not 
currently used by the library) should return simply true or false if it 
does nothing.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61107
(The) with 'proper' should capitalise object name
Problem: In the case of an object with the 'proper' attribute and a 
lower-case name (such as "your nose", "your corduroy trousers", "your 
mother's purse"), the (The) print rule should capitalise the first 
letter of the object name, so that library messages such as (The) x1, " 
", (isorare) x1, " empty." correctly produce "Your mother's purse is 
empty."
Status: Fixed

Issue L61108
indef_mode not restored
Problem: When printing an object with the proper attribute, the 
functions IndefArt( ) and CIndefArt( ) temporarily modify -- but do not 
restore -- the value of the global variable indef_mode (see lines 6305 
and 6315 in parserm.h).
Status: Fixed

Issue L61109
Problem with 'Give reverse' grammar
Status: Fixed

Issue L61111  
Multiple AGAINs treated as one
Status: Fixed

Issue L61112 
WITHOUT_DIRECTIONS causes compilation error
Problem: Version 6/11 of the Inform Library fails to compile if the 
constant WITHOUT_DIRECTIONS is set and the objects 'u_obj' and 'd_obj' 
aren't defined, because a few library routines expect those objects to 
exist.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61113
Size of upper window not restored properly on UNDO
Problem: Compile and run a trivial game with Nitfol. When the game 
begins, type WAIT and then UNDO. Nitfol displays the message [ERROR: 
output]: illegal line for set_cursor (1) 46968 (1,1) This happens in 
DrawStatusLine() and the reason is that the upper window has height 0, 
but the Library tries to position the cursor at (1,1).
Comment: I couldn't get Nitfol to complain like this, but applied the 
fix anyhow.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61114
Numbers in the name property
Problem: See file nametest.inf
Status: trying to understand the problem






Issue L61118
'thedark.initial' is never called
Problem: The library thoughtfully provides thedark.initial, but it is 
never called unless you are diabolical enough to make thedark contained 
by some location, which I'm sure is not what it was meant for. The DM is 
a bit contradictory about the purpose of thedark.initial, but the 
functionality that makes the most sense is that it is called at the 
transition from lighted to darkened. This makes up a gap in 
functionality: NewRoom() is called on light-to-light and dark-to-light; 
DarkToDark() is called on dark-to-dark, but absolutely nothing is called 
on light-to-dark.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61121
add_to_scope of parentless object causes error
Problem: Consider an object which has no parent, and is brought into 
scope by an add_to_scope property. An attempt to take that object causes 
error messages:
  [** Programming error: tried to test "has" or "hasnt" of nothing **]
  [** Programming error: tried to test "has" or "hasnt" of nothing **]
  That's hardly portable.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61124
Spurious space with 'articles' property
Problem: The rarely-used articles property defines an array of strings. 
(The property is provided for non-English languages where irregular 
nouns may have unusual vowel-contraction rules with articles.) The DM4 
gives an example appropriate for a French game, with three strings in 
the array:
Object  "haricot"
    with  name 'haricot' 'legume',
          articles "Le "   "le "   "un ",
          ... ;
Note that each string includes its individual trailing space, if 
appropriate. This is important, because a definite article like l' must 
be followed immediately by the object's name, without any intervening 
space. However, in fact a space does appear.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61125
match_list and match_scores over-run
Problem: The problem is that match_list-->number_matched is being 
accessed, when match_list has length only number_matched (that is, 
entries 0..number_matched-1). In particular this causes errors when the 
match_list is of full length (64 entries). Similarly for match_scores.
Status: Fixed

Issue L61127 
Improve multiexcept look-ahead
Problem: When the parser processes a grammar line that uses multiexcept 
or multiinside, it jumps ahead to match the second noun in order to 
provide context for the first one. However, in doing so, it skips over 
all the prepositions in the input, without caring whether they match the 
prepositions in the grammar line. If the second noun is ambiguous, this 
means the player may be asked a disambiguation question for a grammar 
line that has no chance of succeeding, whereas the grammar line that 
eventually succeeds might not even need disambiguation (thanks to a 
different token type or ChooseObjects).
This also fixes L61120
Status: Fixed

Issue L61129
Results from 'grammar' property are misplaced.
Problem: An animate or talkable object's grammar property can return 1 
to mean (quoting from DM4) "you can stop parsing now because I have done 
it all, and put the resulting order into the variables action, noun and 
second". However, the library code to handle this return value does not 
work correctly.
Status: Fixed
