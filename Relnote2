Minor revision of Inform library 6/10
=====================================

A number of small and easily corrected mistakes in library
6/10 have been pointed out to me, and rather than wait months
for 6/11 I've simply updated 6/10.  (The corrected version has
serial number 991113 instead of 991106 but still has release
number 6/10.)

The modifications are:

298. The Infix debugging verbs are now "meta", as they should
have been all along.  (This means that they do not cause time
to pass within the model world.)
299. Some code testing the removal of hyphens and apostrophes
had been accidentally left inside the release version of
"English.h" in 6/10: I've removed this code again.  Hyphens
and apostrophes should once again be parsed normally.
300. A small bug in the disambiguation routines meant that
"put all on table" wasn't working properly because it (wrongly)
chose items which weren't held for the "all" part, and then
rejected them as not being held.  Oops, etc.  Thanks to
Neil Cerutti, who both found and found a way to fix this.

And so I reach my 300th cockup after all.  The corrected
library 6/10 (my third attempt by now) is at:

   ftp://ftp.gmd.de/incoming/if-archive/l610_3.zip

On some machines, these files will also need ".h" attached.
(Volker and David normally expand this archive for the benefit
of those uncomfortable with zips when it is put into its
permanent position.)
